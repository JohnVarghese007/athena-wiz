## Athena-Wiz
- This is an ongoing mini-project that i plan to complete in a few more days
- The objective is to create a package (the likes of which can be pip installed) that allows the user to plot basic charts(line charts, histogram) and maybe some other basic operations with csv files/excel files directly through the terminal.
- This isnt really a serious project, and is more along the lines of "ooh i had free time over the weekend"
- Too lazy to type more...:)
